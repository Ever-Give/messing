Synopsis:

Amber and Beth are in serious trouble. All they dream of is going to University and escaping their teens, but Nicola, their controlling, megalomaniacal tutor, is making it impossible. Beth can. She has all sorts of tricks up her sleeve, as well as a confident, smarmy attitude. Time is running short and the girls are under pressure. Can they make the impending deadline, and have the night on the town of their dreams?

Im just sharing the story since I think its really great. I wish I could post the whole thing here but I am not the original creator of it, plus there are a bunch of illustrations coupled with the story, I just helped the author here and there so I don't want to claim their work.
