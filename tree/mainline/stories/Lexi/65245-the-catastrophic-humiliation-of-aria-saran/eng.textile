This story was written by me in April 2018. It is based somewhat on the story "The Unmasking of Sameera Khan", which I wrote in January 2011. This story is longer, more detailed and different in several ways. Some aspects are similar. Here is the link.

No. I scrapped those. I do not have any other full stories. I'm looking for some original ideas.

Hypno-Papa, I did not have time to write any new stories. I need new ideas. Am willing to consider suggestions from others. Or themes. I could take a suggestion or theme/themes and build on that, adding various elements.

Sure. This was written 10 years ago.
