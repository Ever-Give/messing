This story is based on ideas suggested by Downjacket.

It is about an American Silicon Valley billionaire, a young beautiful Russian gold-digger, a technology event at a high-end mountain ski-resort, a desperation situation that gradually develops, and circumstances that eventually end in public humiliation.

Warning:

The story is very long and detailed, and builds up slowly. I had to build up the gold-digger's lavish world first, in order for the eventual humiliation to be more effective.
