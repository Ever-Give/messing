Please finish this was so good!

}}

Thank you so much!

I intend to finish this story, and I have a lot of the next chapter done already. Just life got in the way really bad.

Can't say for certain when the next chapter will come out, but I really appreciate everyone's patience.

At the very least, here's the first page-and-a-half or so of the next chapter, which has been done for like, three months. Just to prove that some work has been done.

Chapter 5: Breakthrough

Katie shuffled back and forth, eyes locked to the floor and face burning red. Beside her, Miles stood in a similar state of awkward discomfort, Which is bullshit, Katie thought, He’s got clean pants on, now. She tried to silently pull up her ever-sagging pants and panties, which were still wet and full of her own mess. Jenny had demanded to use the shelter’s only shower immediately, leaving Katie to fend for herself.

“Well, this is kind of a funny reversal, at least,” Miles said, finally breaking the silence.

“How do you mean?”

“Last time, it was me standing around needing new pants.”

“Yeah but it’s still me who wants to die of embarrassment. You had no idea you peed your pants.”

“Hey, they had me running all across town in those pants. Who knows how many people saw me like that,” Something like dread crossed his face, “Really, seriously not looking forward to those conversations… ”

“Oh! Uh,” For as much self-pity as she was prepared to wallow in, she went through all of it to help Miles, and wasn’t about to let him feel terrible, too, “You probably won’t have to worry about it very much. Nobody really seems to notice all that much.”

“How could they not?”

“I mean, how long were you working at the docks?”

He looked confused, and then distressed, “I… don’t think I can really remember. It was a few weeks, at least.”

Katie grimaced, “Um, I hate to be the one to tell you this, dude, but that mind control shit they gave you makes you, uh, go to the bathroom in your pants, like, every time they use it to make you do something.”

“You… You aren’t saying what I think you’re saying, right?”

“In the time you were working for them, you probably peed and… did other stuff… in your pants like twice a day.”

He slowly raised his hand and massaged his temples. As ashamed as he clearly was, she kind of hoped he’d stay stuck on it. It was better that he was worried about having soiled himself, rather than losing his mind wondering what evil stuff they might’ve made him do.

“How could I not have noticed in all that time? How did nobody else notice? I mean, why didn’t anyone say anything?! A guy walking around in full pants like it’s nothing is not normal!”

“I don’t fuckin’ know, man. They might just put something in the water, or maybe it’s cause most of us have been around the magic jewelry at least a bit. The little signs that something’s wrong just don’t register.”

“It registered when your friend took my ring off. Not everyone has jewelry, why don’t they see it?”

She shrugged, “Like I said, no idea. In fact, now I think about it… ” She put a hand to her chin, as a revelation struck her, “Yeah, wait a sec, I think I’m on to something. All four of us- you, me, Jenny, and our other friend Chelle- each of us got our gem taken away, then noticed our accidents right away. In truth, that might’ve helped us snap out of it. But pointedly, we only noticed right when we were reeling from having the mind control end. So now I’m really convinced that there’s something out there making everyone just not notice it.”

He seemed to consider her words for a moment, “... Well, it would be a pretty shitty way for them to get caught, if everyone noticed.”

Katie laughed, “I tell you all that, and you make it into a bad pun? Is this what I did to Jenny earlier?”

“Don’t get so pissy about it.”

She laughed again, “I am pissy. And I would really like to stop being pissy, but someone’s hogging the shower!”

“You did this to me!” Came the still angry voice of Jenny from the bathroom.

They both chuckled, as the awkwardness finally abated. Even if the smell didn’t. Figures. Miles and I are finally getting to hang out again, and I’m forced to stand here in my own piss and shit like a baby. “But for real,” Miles began, distracting her from her thoughts, “Thank you for saving me. Seriously. Who knows what they were doing with me in there… ”

“Oh yeah, uh, of course, dude!” She blushed.

“You and Jenny really snuck in there, using the little microphones to communicate? Cause that’s some serious spy shit there.”

“Be careful, Miles,” She said, “You’re dangerously close to telling the woman who got so scared that she pooped herself how cool she was.”

“Heh. Well, it was cool. You were. You are. I wouldn’t have had the guts to even attempt it, so how could I say anything about the woman who actually went for it, and won?”

Her heart fluttered at his praise, and for a moment she could only stare at him.

“... Even if she smells like a paper mill, right now,” He smirked. She punched him in the arm.

The door to the bathroom clicked as the lock was undone, and Katie sprinted for it. She was not going to spend another second in those clothes.

Hello, I finally finished up this chapter. Had the outline and a lot of the bulk of it done for some time, and finally got some time to finish it. I still am probably gonna be kinda scarce for a while, but I'm happy to have gotten something done.

The first few paragraphs are a repeat of the preview up above, but the rest is all new.

Hope you enjoy!

Everyone, including Chelle, had agreed to meet back up at the hideout the following day. Chelle needed to be caught up on what happened, Miles needed to be briefed on everything, and they needed a plan moving forward. They also didn’t know whether or not it was safe for Miles to return to his actual home, so Katie inarticulately and embarrassedly proposed he stay the night in the shelter. The night ended with Both of them insisting the other take the bed, and both wound up sleeping on the floor to make a point to the other.

Jenny arrived first, because she, in her own words, “Wanted to see Chelle flip out,” when Katie explained the prior day’s events. Not much later, Chelle finally reached the hideout, and got her explanation.

“Katie, all you had to do was tell me you were so hungry, you know,” She said calmly.

“Well, you took it better than I did. Almost strangled the kid,” Jenny muttered.

Katie looked around the room, anywhere but at Chelle, “I know! But I just… I needed to… get out, I guess.”

She couldn’t give much more of an explanation than that, and a silence settled on the room, until Miles spoke, “Hey, for what it’s worth, I’m pretty happy things went the way they did.”

“Oh yeah! Guess I should introduce you. Miles, that’s my friend Chelle. She rescued me, like we rescued you. Chelle, this is my old friend Miles.”

Once introductions were out of the way, it was time to pool their knowledge, and talk strategy. Katie finally got to discuss her theory, and began the talk, “Okay so… At this point, we’ve all done it, so I’m just gonna throw it out there with no shame: I think the fact that all of us noticed our accidents right after getting our jewelry taken off is somehow significant, and it might be the reason the brainwashing fully wore off.” She inhaled when she finished her rant.

“Significant how?” Chelle asked.

“Well, um, when you told me about how you got snapped out of it, you said that the first thing you noticed was that you fell backwards onto the, uh, the mess… in your pants… ”

“... Right,” Chelle murmured, not happy that that particular story was being recounted.

“And then I… ” The young redhead let her sentence drift off, blushing hotly, “Also had an accident, and-”

“No, no, wait a sec!” Chelle called out, “You don’t get to talk about mine and then just skip over yours!”

“Okay, fine, I-”

“She’d peed a good amount in her jeans, made a big stain that reached her knees,” Chelle was telling the story with a smile, clearly enjoying herself, “When I took off her necklace, she got so overwhelmed and confused that she peed a bunch more, till she was standing in a huge puddle.”

“Thank you, Chelle,” Katie said in a low, angry tone. Miles chuckled, not at the story, but at Katie’s reaction. She coughed, and resumed, “Jenny had just wet herself when Chelle popped her necklace off, and noticed it right away. And finally, Miles had wet himself much earlier in the day, but still snapped out of it when Jenny pointed it out to him.”

“And you think that both of those events are important?” Chelle asked, “Taking off the jewelry and noticing the accident? Just doing one wouldn’t be enough?”

“Probably not. I dunno about you two, but when my necklace got taken, all I was thinking about was getting it back.”

“Ditto.”

“Yup.”

“But when we lost the jewelry, and someone or something made us notice that we’d had an accident in our pants, something that’s ordinarily a big deal, it broke through the last bit of brainwashing.”

“So we just gotta take someone’s jewels then tell ‘em they shat themselves? Seems a bit too easy,” Jenny said.

“That’s what I wanna try and test today. Mainly seeing how people react to their accidents while still brainwashed. And trying to figure out why the non-brainwashed people aren’t noticing. Oh, and hypothetically, they don’t have to notice the state of their pants, specifically. As long as it’s something severe enough to cause a big emotional response, I think. So like, if they were hurt or something, you could probably just bring that up, instead.”

“But wearing the jewelry makes you just go to the bathroom in your pants, right?” Miles asked.

“Sorta. When they give you a command, it messes with your bodily control. We think it has something to do with it overloading your brain,” Chelle answered.

“So that’s probably gonna be the easiest one to point out, since just about all the victims will have done it.”

With everyone up to speed, Katie took the stage, “So, here’s today’s plan: things are way too hot for me to be outside the shelter right now. Besides that, I still need to try and crack open this box you guys stole. So you three are gonna just wander around town, and try to provoke people into noticing their accidents or other weird behavior. See how they react, if they do at all.”

“But, shouldn’t we try and rescue them?” Miles asked, “I’ve been feeling real weird since you guys saved me, and I don’t wanna think about what they were making me do. I don’t wanna leave people to that.”

“It’s a matter of necessity. Until we know more, we can’t risk drawing too much attention to ourselves. If we suddenly had a group of thirty people, they’d spot us in a heartbeat. And if one person gets recaptured, they won’t be able to resist ratting us all out. We gotta be slow and careful about this,” Katie explained, but Miles still seemed quite distressed, “Don’t worry, we’re gonna save everybody. We just gotta be smart about it.”

“Sounds like a plan,” Jenny rose, “I’ll be in touch soon with my results.”

“Certainly easier than some of our other operations,” Chelle intoned.

“Oh, and Miles,” Katie said before he turned to leave, “Be careful, okay?”

“No promises.”

###

Chelle had lived in Ravenwood her whole life, and even she hadn’t noticed when the trouble began. At least, not until she got her necklace taken off and snapped out of the mind control. Now, as she wandered through the town, she had no idea how the sight had escaped her attention. Just about every third person she saw needed a change of pants. Surely this is recent, right? It can’t have been this bad the whole time.

A jogger passed her on the sidewalk; her white shorts were stained yellow, and she left a trail of droplets behind her.

A man and a woman were talking with each other, and a large urine stain traveled down the man’s leg as he spoke. The woman’s pants were stained brown in the back, and had a slight bulge. Neither of them seemed to notice.

The sights were making her conscious of her own bodily needs. Her bladder nagged her a little, and she wondered if it might be suspicious to use a public restroom. She’d grown pretty used to using her pants as a restroom, but she preferred to only do it if she had to. Pragmatism could only overpower her desire to not piss herself under dire circumstances.

A jingle from her phone distracted her from her needs, and she looked to see a text message. For a brief second, she worried that it was from Katie, Jenny, or Miles, somebody reporting that something had gone wrong, but then she saw the sender’s name. Leslie. Guilt cut through her like a knife. Leslie was her best friend, but she hadn’t been able to free her, yet. It broke her heart to leave her like that, but she hadn’t had the chance to save her. But the text was promising: an invitation to hang out. It seemed to Chelle to be a golden opportunity; Leslie would be rather open to questioning from her, and could provide some important information. She responded, and agreed.

“So where on Earth have you been?” Leslie asked. Most people would’ve been angry or concerned when their friend vanished for a few weeks, but Leslie asked with an understanding smile.

“Yeah, sorry,” Chelle began, trying to think of an excuse, “Went out of town for a bit, then had to deal with work stuff. Haven’t gotten two minutes to myself in weeks.”

“You poor thing,” She said, “Wanna grab something to eat? I know how sweets cheer you up, and I know where to get a peach milkshake.”

“Um. Y-yes, please!” Chelle knew that going out to get a milkshake was not in the mission description, but the temptation was too strong. She was relieved that Leslie wasn’t mad at her, but in retrospect she should’ve guessed that her old friend wouldn’t have been upset. Leslie wore a light blue sweater and a long, green skirt that reached a little bit past her knees. Her long, brown hair blew in the wind, undoing the careful brushing she’d given it earlier. Unfortunately, all Chelle could really see was the necklace glittering around her throat. Her despair deepened when her friend took her hand, and she noticed the cursed ring around one of her fingers. She was double-brainwashed. At the very least, she hadn’t wet or soiled herself just yet.

They ordered their sugary snacks, and walked back outside. Her old friend was right, the treat most certainly did make her feel a bit better. She took the opportunity to try and ask some pointed questions, “So Leslie, like I said, I was outta town for a little bit. Does anything seem weird to you?”

“Um, weird how? You get a haircut or something?”

“No no, like, in town.”

Leslie’s face scrunched in concentration, “Nnnnooo? I don’t think I’ve noticed anything off.”

On the other side of the street, a woman sat on a park bench, reading something on her phone. Underneath her, several streams of piss rained down to the ground, noisily splattering and creating a large pool. “Like, over there? Nothing seems kinda funny to you?”

“What’re you getting at?” Leslie seemed quite confused. She really doesn’t notice. Maybe I need to be a little more direct…

“Y’know what, forget about it. I gotta use the bathroom, anyway.” Chelle put an undue amount of emphasis on the word, hoping it would spark something in her friend.

“Me too, actually.” Leslie replied. For a second, Chelle was happy, since it could’ve indicated progress, but then Leslie just stood there.

“Uh, Leslie? Bathroom?”

“Hang on, almost done… ” The response made Chelle’s heart sink. Sure enough, streams of hot urine ran down her old friend’s legs, wetting her socks and flowing into shoes. The piss flowed over the sides of her sneakers, and created two small puddles beside each of her feet. But she wasn’t done, as she scrunched up her face again, but this time for a much more embarrassing reason. She grunted quietly, and then looked quite relieved. “All right, I’m done,” A smell filled the air, originating from the back of Leslie’s panties. “Aren’t you gonna go, dude?”

“Uh, I was thinking about using the actual… ” Before she even finished the sentence, it was clear that Leslie didn’t understand, “... Yeah, just a little pee-shy, I guess.” Chelle gave up, and resigned herself to the inevitable. Forcing herself to let go, she felt the wet warmth begin to spread in her briefs. The wet spot appeared on the front of her jeans, and spread all across her front rapidly, before spilling down the insides of her pants. She’d long since learned to focus on the relief, rather than the shame. “I’m uh, all done.”

“Great, then let’s get a move-on!” Her friend took her hand and resumed walking, totally indifferent to her own wet and loaded panties.

“Isn’t that kinda uncomfortable?”

“What? My sweater? It’s actually softer than it looks-”

“No no, your underpants.”

“Michelle, I know you’re not about to tell me you were trying to look up my skirt,” Leslie said it with a slight chuckle, but she could tell something like that would actually bother her.

“No I didn’t, I’m talking about the fact that you… y’know, went to the bathroom in them?”

“I, uuuhhh?” She seemed a little taken aback, “I used the… bathroom… ” She sounded like she was trying to fit the pieces together, but was struggling. Come on, Leslie, fight it! “In my underpants?”

“Yeah, you pooped in your panties. Isn’t it kinda uncomfortable to walk around in that?”

“Why… Why would it be?” She was clearly doubting the sentence even as she said it.

Chelle placed her hand on Leslie’s backside, pressing the mess in her panties up against her rear, grimacing at the disgusting nature of the action and the breach of privacy. “You didn’t always go to the bathroom like this, right? You never had accidents in your pants.”

“Chelle!” She hopped forward, away from Chelle’s hand, and placed her own on her butt. “That’s uncalled for. You can’t just grab my butt and my… my… mess in my underwear… ” Something was dawning on her; she was realizing that something was wrong.

“You all right, there?”

“Yeah, I just feel like I forgot something kinda important.” She shrugged, “Eh, it’ll probably come back to me. Can’t be that important if I forgot it, right?”

“... Right… ” Chelle agreed, suppressing her disappointment. It was only a sample size of one, but thus far it seemed that Katie was right- A brainwashed person needed to have the sudden revelation occur when their jewelry was removed, not before. Additionally, it was gonna start raising suspicions if more people Chelle knew were suddenly freed from the hypnosis. Eventually, they were gonna work out that she was working against them. So, as much as she hated it, she had little choice but to leave Leslie as she was.

Well, she’s still my friend. Wet pants or not, I might as well enjoy some time with her. Maybe see what else I can learn.

###

Jenny absentmindedly clutched the counterfeit necklace. By this point, she was confident enough that the townspeople wouldn’t notice that it was a fake, but wearing it still troubled her. The sensation of her mind being dominated was still fresh, and even wearing a bogus replica triggered some kind of response inside her. She took a deep breath, and cleared her head. There was work to do. Existential crises could wait.

She’d randomly wandered around town until she found herself on the outskirts of some strip mall, with plenty of people coming and going. As expected, everyone was going about their business normally, even though a sizable portion of them had or presently were going to the bathroom on themselves. Jenny already thought the coastal town smelled fishy and uninviting, but now some areas truly reeked.

And not a single person seemed to actually notice. Jenny had to admit that the concern of the bad guys putting something in the water was not unfounded. Whatever they’d done, it had most certainly made it so even the people who weren’t hypnotized failed to notice the sudden influx of accidents everywhere. She decided to put those individuals to the test.

After several minutes of trying to subtly stare at passersby to determine if they were wearing jewelry or not, she finally spotted the perfect candidates: A young man, with two young ladies. Both of the man’s friends wore jewelry, and it showed- one had a big wet stain on the front of her skirt; the other had a messy lump in the back of her jeans. The young man, however, had no jewelry, and thus had clean pants and underwear. And, as expected, he seemed to pay absolutely no mind to his friends’ mistreatment of their pants.

Like a proper stalker, Jenny followed the party for a while, trying to observe their behavior. From her long career in not following the law, she was pretty good at tailing people without being seen, and she used that skill to the fullest. Although, typically, she would shadow people who were armed and dangerous, not a group of college student-aged randos with two-thirds of their underpants ruined. It was easy enough, in comparison.

Not like there was all that much to see, though. They told jokes, poked around in stores, and hung out. She didn’t really know what she was expecting, though. They were just out and about, having fun, after all. She did observe the jeans woman check her phone briefly, and then piss herself as she looked at it. She just received some sorta command, I’m guessing, Jenny thought. She noted that the other two did not make the effort to step over or around the puddle she’d made. So they weren’t aware of it, or they just didn’t care.

But now that she thought about it, why were so many people soiling themselves? Jenny had only wet herself when she got hypnotized and given a command. Surely all of these people weren’t being issued commands so frequently.

Unless… She stopped and looked around. A lot of people were on their phones. An ordinary sight, in ordinary times, sure. But she was positive she was onto something. A healthy number of people in ruined pants had their phone in hand, or in their face. A woman sitting at a bench was actively pissing herself as she read something on her phone.

And I was hypnotized once… Jenny whipped out her phone. It was almost always muted, out of habit. She couldn’t have it going off when she was stealing something, after all. She was relieved to discover no new messages.

But she wanted to know just what was being sent out. She closed the distance on the group she’d been following. They entered some little convenience store, and Jenny made a mental note that the clean-pantsed man actually entered the bathroom. It looked like he’d be getting home dry. She slowly approached the jeans woman, careful not to be too loud or hasty. As soon as she saw her opening, two of her fingers flew into the other woman’s pocket, and retrieved her phone. After a little fiddling, Jenny muted the stolen phone, and shoved it into her own pocket.

Stepping away into a different aisle, she pulled it back out and opened the messages. The most recent was from someone registered as “Monarch.”

“Be a dear and remember to donate to the Ravenwood Historical Society today!”

That’s it? Just some scheme for money? For a damn museum?

Well, it was something. It most certainly incriminated the Society, and gave them a target to chase after. Although, “Monarch” didn’t tell them much of anything. It could be a single person or a group. She moved for the exit, stolen phone still in hand. Katie would want to see it.

###

Now seeing what was really going on in his hometown, Miles was stunned. The number of people just casually going about their day with a load in their underwear was astonishing. And he cringed to recall that he’d been one of them for some time. He really hoped that everyone else had been hypnotized when he was running around in wet shorts. It had been bad enough that Katie had seen him like that, but he seriously hoped that at least some of his dignity could be salvaged.

Once he’d overcome the shock and the negative feelings it dredged up in him, he pushed on. He did have a job to do, after all. Although, he had to be a bit more careful than the others did. Chelle and Jenny would only be recognizable to a handful of people, and they knew how to play along. Miles on the other hand, had no earthly idea who would recognize him, or how to act if they spotted him. He figured that as long as he avoided the docks, he ought to be fine.

Which brought to his attention the strong urge he felt to go to the docks. He was certain that it was not normal, natural curiosity. Maybe his brain just wanted to try and fill in all the missing memories he had, but he was positive that something external was pulling him back. Frankly, it scared the shit out of him. He felt like his own head didn’t belong to him anymore.

After he’d wandered around for some time, he realized that he hadn’t been paying any attention. Like reading a book and zoning out, then having to reread the last couple pages. He walked though a quiet neighborhood, and he wasn’t entirely certain when or how he got there. He was supposed to be studying the people in the town, but he couldn’t focus. He was getting worried; this was not normal. The sun was shining bright, too bright. Giving him a headache. It was quiet around him, but he still felt like he was getting a sensory overload.

He sped up, keeping his eyes down, on the ground in front of him. He forced himself to focus on the cracks and pebbles on the ground, anchoring himself to the now. After a minute or two of walking like this, he came upon a small park, with some people in it. He felt like he was actually able to keep his head on straight, this time. He found a bench in the shade, and sat down, grateful to be out of the sun.

He felt like shit, but he felt even worse that he was being a complete burden to his friends. He was in no state to be conducting any of these spy missions. He sank his hand into his pocket, but froze as he reached his phone. He didn’t want to touch it. He wasn’t sure why, but just reaching for it made his blood run cold. He took a deep breath. He didn’t think he’d be able to make it back home, or to the hideout without help. He needed to contact someone.

He slid his phone out, and clicked it on. The screen lit up, and he saw he had an unread message. He was headed for his texting app anyway, so he opened it. It was from someone called “Monarch.”

“Be a dear and get to the lighthouse. Now.”

He bolted upright as he read the message. Feelings, sensations, and urges rampaged through him. He felt like his body remembered something terrible that his brain did not. Sickness gripped his insides, and unpleasant pains struck his stomach.

“Miles, that you?” Came a voice from behind him. He didn’t look away from the phone. The speaker got closer, “Miles? You all right, chief?” He had the wherewithal to know it was Jenny. He looked up slightly, still sick. “Uh, hello? Are you- gwugh!” She made a sudden and unexpected noise of disgust. He felt hands on his shoulder, and the woman forced him to turn and look at her.

“Jenny?” He asked, dazed.

She gave him a serious look, but didn’t say anything. She plucked the phone from his hands and studied it, her expression souring as she did so. “Miles,” She began in a low voice, “Are you wearing any more jewelry?”

“No. Just the fake.”

“You’re certain?”

“Yes. Why?”

In answer, Jenny grabbed his arm and navigated it to his backside, where it touched a strange lump. He felt the bulge with his hand, and finally the sensation across his butt registered to him. He’d soiled himself at some point. It was warm, and the bulge he felt was soft enough that it was likely recent. Probably as he started to feel sick.

“I…!”

“... You shat your pants, Miles. And you look terrible.”

“I’ve never… messed myself. Why did this… ” He trailed off.

“Katie said that you seemed worse off than the others. I think she was onto something there.”

“Jenny, something’s really wrong. I, I can’t remember things, I-”

The woman stepped in front of him, her face just in front of his, “Calm down, Miles. We’re gonna get to the bottom of all of this. For now, why don’t we get you back to the hideout, hm?”

He blushed, “Can… Can I change my underpants, first?”

“Oh shut up, Katie saw you wet yourself and you saw her crap herself. You’re all used to it by now.”

She grabbed his arm, and guided him back towards the shelter. Even as disturbing as the day had wound up being for him, Miles supposed that this was still kind of information to report back.

Love your stories and thank you for the awesome chapter. Since Katie is my favorite, I must ask if you'll go a little more in depth with her background in the future chapters.

}}

Thank you! And don't worry, each of the main characters will be explored much more throughout future chapters. Jenny and Katie in particular both have backstories to explore, for sure.

Why are my pants suddenly so heavy and wet after hearing that sentence?

Chapter 6: Consequence

It took an unreasonable amount of time, but here's the next chapter! Featuring some prominent accidents from the resident redhead, Katie, here's chapter 6! Sorry for the wait, but I hope everyone enjoys it! It's a bit short, but I didn't want to delay it any longer.

Chelle and Leslie walked through town together, occasionally venturing into the various stores and attractions. Despite her wet pants, and Leslie's wet and full panties, she still truly enjoyed the time she got to spend with her old friend. Soon enough, she’d be called back to business, so she wanted to really relish the simple pleasures while she could. She tried to also do her job and observe the town around her, but she wasn’t able to extrapolate much information other than the fact that everyone was happily wetting and crapping their pants like it was going out of style. She disliked that this included herself.

The two chatted and laughed together, turning a corner onto a familiar street. One that suddenly gave Chelle a spike of anxiety. She wasn’t certain what was wrong, until she looked up, and spotted the sign for Bray’s just a little ways down. Shit!! We gotta go a different direction, Her heart nearly stopped, What if he recognizes me?! He might realize that we stole his package! She opened her mouth to insist they go somewhere else, but Leslie spoke first, “Oh, right, Bray’s. Sad, what happened.”

“Huh?” Chelle looked at her friend, “What do you… What happened at Bray’s?” She was very slow and careful with her question.

“The owner disappeared into thin air. Cops said it looked like some people got him from his bed in the middle of the night.” As they passed the store, the darkened interior and “Closed” signs on the door gave all the evidence she needed.

Chelle stopped and stared into the dark and empty building, her frightened reflection peering back at her. They disappeared him because of us, She realized, with horror. Adding to her mounting panic was the knowledge of just how quickly and quietly they got rid of him. Chelle knew they were going up against someone powerful, but seeing it in action was truly unsettling. She felt the crotch of her cold, clammy pants turn warm once again as her bladder emptied. She slowly looked down, watching as she re-wet her already soaked pants in fear. Her bladder was still mostly empty, so this wetting only reached midway down her thighs.

“Uh, are you all right, Michelle?” Leslie had noticed her sudden alarm.

“Yeah, yeah, fine,” If there was one upside to Ravenwood, pissing yourself didn’t give away how not fine you were, “Just remembered, I promised to help my mom with something today.”

“Aw, really?”

“Yeah, sorry,” She was regaining her composure, and smiled even as the last few droplets of pee ran down her leg.

“Well, promise me that-”

“I’m not gonna disappear again, I promise!” She interrupted.

“That’s all I ask. Tell your mom I said hi!”

They waved goodbye, and Chelle pulled out her phone. Today hadn’t been a waste of time for her after all.

###

Miles, cleaned off and inspected for any immediate damage, had exhaustedly passed out in Katie’s bed in the shelter. Seeing her crush delirious and afraid broke her heart, and she was also not fond of seeing him in soiled pants (though she supposed it did make them even). No sooner had Jenny started to explain the day’s findings and what happened to Miles when Chelle called her, and broke the frightening news.

Now the three of them sat together in the shelter. Under less stressful conditions, they would have teased Chelle over her pants situation, but today they were quiet. “So,” Jenny broke the silence, “Whatever’s in the box is pretty important, huh?”

“Seems that way,” Katie replied, in a small voice “Which is a damn shame, since I cannot get the thing to open for the life of me.”

Chelle spoke up, “Important enough to vanish somebody… Jenny, they did that to him because of us-”

“They did that to him because they’re bad guys, Chelle. He was working for them, and he screwed up, and that’s what happens when you work for bad guys. You get got. We had nothing to do with it.”

Chelle seemed to ease up a little with the reassurance, but Katie gave the criminal a sideways look, “Something tells me you have some experience when it comes to people vanishing,” She was finding Jenny’s apathetic attitude distasteful.

“Look, don’t ask questions you don’t want the answer to,” Jenny answered, unexpectedly without sass, it was a genuine warning, “Let’s just say that I have a skillset I was hoping I wouldn’t have to use here.”

“Jenny, no!” Chelle piped up, “We already got someone… No more!” There were tears threatening to spill from her eyes.

“Dude, if they find out what we’re doing, it’s gonna be the axe for all of us. If it’s them or us, I know my choice.”

“These people are being controlled and manipulated! We can’t just get them killed! Katie, help me out here!”

Both women looked at Katie, making her shrink back. She really didn’t know who to side with. Practically speaking, Jenny was completely correct, and self-defence was a necessary tool. Morally, Katie wasn’t sure how she was going to sleep tonight knowing that the operation she planned had likely earned a brainwashed man a one-way trip to the bottom of the bay. And now they’d rescued Miles, and who knows who might’ve been punished for that.

Ultimately all she could do was look between both of them and shrug. They groaned in frustration at the deadlock that created.

“Look, just, everyone go home,” Katie finally said, “Tomorrow, we’ll look into Monarch, and tonight I’m gonna take another crack at the box.” That seemed to be the best resolution they’d come to that night, and the other women went home. Katie spun in her chair, seeing Miles sprawled out on her bed. He looked like he was in pain. She hated to see it. She wanted to help him so badly. She swore that she’d open the box that night, and use whatever was inside to help him.

###

Hours had passed. Katie didn’t dare to glance at a clock, choosing to believe that time wouldn’t catch up to her if she didn’t look at it. She’d found lockpicking tutorials online, cobbled together some tools, and worked her fury upon the box with single minded determination, and had nothing to show for it. She wanted Miles to get better and wake up, but she really hoped it didn’t happen at that moment, as he’d be treated to a view of Katie looking crazed and frazzled and sitting in just a T-shirt and her underpants.

“Mm… ” She heard a sudden groan behind her, causing her to jump. Miles stirred slightly, looking all the more pained for it. He wasn’t awake, just shifting in his sleep. But seeing him again calmed her down, helped her to remember that she needed to do this for his sake. She pulled up the videos on lockpicking once again, and continued her work.

She tried to mimic what she saw as perfectly as possible. The alternative was just to shoot or blow up the box, which could destroy what was inside, so she had to get it right. Whatever it was was clearly crucial enough for all the secrecy and security, and even got somebody vanished for losing it. It had to be worth all the trouble. Mostly because… I dunno what we’re gonna do if this turns out to be nothing. We’re really betting a lot on this thing being worthwhile.

She gasped when she heard a subtle click from the box. It wasn’t unlocked, but her pick had landed on something it was supposed to. She turned her attention to the videos once again, to see where to proceed. Following their example, she twisted and turned and forced her picks, hearing more rattling and clicking. At long last, she was treated to a loud ker-shunk! From the box. Her heart raced, and she tentatively pushed the lid up with one finger. She almost squealed when the lid actually began to rise. She had done it. The box was open. Her whole body was shaking.

Steeling herself for whatever was inside, she quit hesitating and lifted the lid open. Inside was a large, gaudy necklace. An amulet, more like. In a big, gold medallion on the chain was a gem, far larger than the others she’d seen. But, unlike the rest of the cursed jewelry, this gem was a bright, gleaming red. The others had all been blueish-green. This one was special. Katie knew it had to be. And after all of her hard work, who better to give it a test run?

… Tomorrow.

No way was she going to actually put the thing on without people there to restrain her in case she tried to do something crazy. It could be a super mind-control device for all she knew.

###

“What… is it?” Chelle asked, staring as Katie proudly dangled the necklace from a gloved hand, careful not to actually touch it.

“Dunno,” She shrugged, “I mean, I have a theory, but it’s not concrete.”

“Tell us anyway,” Jenny said.

“Well, I’m sure you both are thinking what I’m thinking. All the security around this, the secrecy, and it looking like an extra crazy version of the bad jewelry… I think this thing lets someone control people.”

The two of them stiffened, their eyes fixed on the extravagant neckwear. “Have you tested it at all, yet?” Jenny asked.

“What, are you kidding? Fuck no, I’m not touching this thing alone!”

“Well, now you’re not alone, time to touch it.”

“But it won’t work without the base jewels,” Chelle interjected, “Katie, you still got those?”

“Inside the box that’s inside the box in the corner,” She replied, as Jenny watched in frustration.

“You kept those things so close by?”

“I tried to study them, but came up empty,” She defended.

Chelle returned with a small ring, with the blue-green gem. She hadn’t put it on yet. “We’re uh… sure about this? Jenny, you ready to stop us if anything goes wrong?”

“You bet.”

“Okay then,” She took a deep breath, and slowly slid the ring onto her finger. She went a little rigid, and stood ready for a command.

Even more trepidatiously, Katie put the amulet around her neck, shuddering intensely as an icy sensation washed over her whole body. “Fuuuuck… ” She breathed, suddenly dizzy, and wobbling in her chair. She shook her head, and made eye contact with Chelle, who stood practically at attention. “Okay, uh, Chelle, uh… ”

“‘Be a dear’,” Jenny supplied.

“Right! Chelle, be a dear, and uh, jump!”

Obediently, Chelle jumped. But that was only part of the experiment. Both other women stared at Chelle’s pants, expecting to see a stain, or suddenly detect an unpleasant smell. Nothing happened.

“Huh. Umm, Chelle, be a dear and take off your shoes?”

Once again, she did as she was told, sliding off her shoes and exposing her socks. Once again, Katie and Jenny leaned forward to search for any sign of an accident. Dry and not messy.

Jenny sighed, “Chelle’s not gonna object to you asking her to jump, you know. She’ll do anything if you ask her nicely enough. Monarch is making people piss themselves by demanding they give them all their money.”

“Oh, that’s right! Good point! Chelle, be a dear and gimme your wallet!”

Chelle reached into her pocket and produced her wallet, dutifully handing it to the redheaded woman. No wetting, no soiling.

“Huh. Not working. Also, it just dawned on me how weird it is that we’re staring at our friend’s crotch to see if we can make her pee her pants.”

“For the love of… She knows you're just gonna give it back! You gotta make her do something she’d never do otherwise!” Jenny walked forward and snatched the necklace from Katie, and fastened it around her own neck, shivering as the unnatural cold washed over her. “Chelle, be a dear and give your ring to Katie,” She commanded.

The woman did as instructed, but naturally the effect of the command ended once Chelle had taken off the ring. “Whoa, wha-” She began, then her eyes shot downwards. She began patting down her inner thighs, then her butt. “Hey, I’m clean!” Chelle declared.

“Yup. Time for plan B. Put this on,” Jenny took the ring, and tossed it to Katie.

“Wha- what are you gonna make me do that I would never do otherwise?” The smaller woman asked, somewhat fearful.

“It’s a surprise,” The older woman smiled. Katie worriedly put on the ring, and went slightly rigid, just like Chelle. “Check this out,” Jenny said to Chelle, “Hey Katie, be a dear and show us your internet history!”

Immediately, the room was filled with a loud hissing, as the crotch of Katie’s black shorts glistened with wetness. Her piss spread across her butt as she sat, and puddled around her, soaking the backside of her pants completely. The pool began to spill over the side of her chair, which she spun towards her computer to follow the order she was given. She left quite a mess as the urine was sloshed from the chair onto the floor below her.

Jenny laughed, and Chelle chuckled lightly at the display.

“I guess it works,” Chelle said.

“Well, we don’t know that!” Jenny said, still giggling, “Be a dear and stand up.” Katie stood, apparently still peeing, as twin streams visibly ran down both of her legs. “Be a dear and shit your pants.”

Katie hunched forward a little bit, straining. After a second, there was a wet squelch, and Jenny could see a smooth, round bulge forming on Katie’s backside. The waistband of her shorts slid down an inch as her panties were loaded up. She strained once more, and her mess grew by a third. “All done,” The redhead announced.

Jenny sneered, while Chelle looked on in concern, asking “Was that really necessary?”

“Katie, be a dear and sit back down in your piss chair.”

The hacker complied, nonchalantly setting herself down in her gaming chair with a splash and a squish that made both of the other women cringe. Her mess had surely spread all across her butt.

Jenny beamed with satisfaction. “All right, be a dear and take off the ring.”

Almost as soon as she slid the ring from her finger, Katie yelped in shock, dropping it to the floor. Her hands shot to her groin, attempting to grab herself, or cover her pee-soaked pants. “Aaah, I peed my-” She stopped mid-sentence, face going pale, and wiggled her legs. Once she felt the state of the load in her panties, she gagged. “W-what did you do?! Why did you make me poop myself and- and then sit in it?!”

“Revenge,” Jenny said simply, “Now we’re even for the other day.”

“Y-yeah, okay… I guess I… had this coming.”

“Oh my… ” Chelle breathed. The others looked at her, but she was focused on Katie’s computer monitor, which still had her history pulled up on it.

Fast as lightning, Katie grabbed the mouse and closed out of it, but the damage was done. “Shut up!” She shouted. Grabbing her shorts by the waistband to hold them up, she ran for the bathroom, sprinkling a few droplets of pee as she ran. She slammed the door and turned the lock, and the sounds of the shower running could be heard.

“Proud of yourself?” Chelle asked, disappointed.

“Oooh yeah.”
