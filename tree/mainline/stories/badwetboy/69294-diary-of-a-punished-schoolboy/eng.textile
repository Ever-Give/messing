Diary of a punished schoolboy

I'm standing in a small room off of a busy hallway. The room is empty aside from a chalkboard mounted on the wall behind me, on it are a few tally marks. The door is propped open so anyone passing can see inside.

Evidence of accidents are obvious in the dampness at the front of my uniform pants and the sagging bulge at the back. But those are from a while ago and my day is far from over. I'm shaking with desperation, my knees clamped together, my feet constantly shifting, my face twisted in the effort to hold it. Tears fall as I lose control and start to soak myself.

Fresh wetness shows on my pants and a puddle spreads at my feet. With a whimper I turn and add another mark to the board. How many more marks will I have to make before I am permitted to leave this spot and change my unfortunate clothes?
