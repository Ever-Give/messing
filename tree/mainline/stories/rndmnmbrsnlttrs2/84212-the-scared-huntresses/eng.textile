This story was written by an AI.

No, wait, come back! It was written by ChatGPT, and it's actually really good. I've tried using NovelAI and Ai Dungeon and the like before to generate stories, but the results are always very lacking - in grammar, in consistency, and in coherence.

This is not.

To write it I just provided an initial prompt of "Write a story where Weiss Schnee goes through Beacon Initiation. Write with a ludicrous amount of detail and dialogue. Describe character's appearances in detail. Write with a dark tone." Then every 5-10 paragraphs it would finish and I would write something like "Continue, with Weiss getting so scared she has an accident". I've copied the results here, with the only massaging being blending some of the opening/closing lines from each response, as it sometimes does a mini conclusion/introduction that can be pretty repetitive.

There are a couple times where it reuses the same exact phrase, but otherwise it's really incredible, pretty much indistinguishable from a (pretty good) human writer, but one that can spit out 7,500 words in an hour, with exactly the kind of story you're looking for.

Without further ado:

Weiss Schnee stood at the entrance to Beacon Academy, her heart racing with a mix of nerves and determination. She had always dreamed of becoming a huntsman, just like her father, and now was her chance to prove herself.

As she stepped through the gates, she took in the sight of the sprawling campus, with its towering spires and immaculate gardens. She couldn't help but feel a twinge of intimidation at the thought of the rigorous training that lay ahead.

Weiss was a slender young woman with long, white hair that cascaded down her back in sleek waves. She had piercing blue eyes and a sharp, angular face, with a small, upturned nose and full, rose-colored lips. She wore a white and blue uniform, with a flowing skirt and knee-high boots, and a silver rapier hung at her side.

She made her way to the initiation grounds, where a group of students had already gathered. Some of them were chatting nervously, while others seemed to be sizing up their competition. Weiss tried to appear confident as she scanned the crowd, but inside she was shaking.

"Hey, Weiss!" called a voice from behind her. She turned to see a tall, broad-shouldered young man with spiky blond hair and a goofy grin. It was Jaune Arc, a fellow first-year student.

"Hey, Jaune," Weiss replied with a small smile. "Are you ready for this?"

"As ready as I'll ever be," Jaune chuckled. "I just hope I don't embarrass myself out there."

"You'll do fine," Weiss reassured him, though she secretly wondered if she would fare any better. She had always been a top student at her previous school, but Beacon was a whole other level of competition. She took a deep breath and tried to steady her nerves. It was time to show what she was made of.

Suddenly, the initiation began, and the students were launched into the Grimm-infested forest, each one given a small window of time to prove their worth. Weiss drew her rapier, her eyes darting around as she tried to take in her surroundings. She had always been skilled with a sword, but the fear of facing real Grimm was making her hands shake.

As she made her way through the dense underbrush, she heard a faint sound behind her. She turned, her rapier at the ready, and saw a young girl with short, black hair and a red cloak. It was Ruby Rose, another first-year student at Beacon.

"Hey, Weiss!" Ruby called out, waving. "Looks like we're partners for the initiation!"

"Great," Weiss muttered, trying to hide her anxiety. She had never liked working with others, preferring to rely on her own skills. But she knew she couldn't afford to be picky in the face of Grimm.

As they made their way deeper into the forest, they were ambushed by a pack of Beowolves. Weiss's heart pounded in her chest as she fought back, her rapier flashing as she parried and thrust. But despite her best efforts, she couldn't shake the fear that was clawing at her stomach.

In the heat of battle, Weiss felt a sudden, embarrassing warmth spreading down her legs. She had wet herself, her fear and adrenaline taking over. Mortified, she redoubled her efforts, determined to prove to herself and her partner that she was worthy of being a huntsman. But with each passing moment, she couldn't shake the feeling that she had already failed.

Ruby noticed Weiss's accident immediately, and couldn't help but snicker at her teammate's embarrassment. "Uh, Weiss," she said, trying to suppress a grin. "I think you might want to change your pants."

Weiss's face turned red with shame. "Shut up, Ruby," she snapped, trying to cover her tracks. "It's not funny."

"Hey, no need to get defensive," Ruby said, holding up her hands in surrender. "We all get scared sometimes. I mean, I'm terrified of the dark, so if we end up in a cave or something, you can just leave me behind."

Weiss's expression softened slightly at the admission. She had always known that Ruby was kind and understanding, but she had never expected her to be so open about her own fears.

As they continued through the gloomy forest, Weiss couldn't help but feel a sense of camaraderie with her partner. Despite their differences, they were both just kids trying to make it through a tough initiation.

But their sense of unity was short-lived, as Ruby suddenly stumbled and let out a yelp. "Oh no, not again," she moaned, as a wet patch began to spread across the front of her pants.

"Ruby, what the hell?" Weiss said, her anger melting away as she realized what had happened.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," Ruby said, looking down at her pants in dismay. "I don't know why this always happens to me. I guess I'm just really scared of the dark."

Weiss couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. Here they were, two first-year students at Beacon Academy, both of them with wet pants and no way to change. But somehow, it didn't seem so bad anymore. They were in this together, and that was all that mattered.

Despite their shared embarrassment, Ruby and Weiss had a hard time working together. They kept getting in each other's way and snapping at each other, their nerves and exhaustion making it difficult to communicate effectively.

"Ruby, stop running ahead!" Weiss shouted, as the black-haired girl charged ahead without warning. "We need to stay together and watch each other's backs!"

"Well maybe you should keep up, Weiss!" Ruby retorted, rolling her eyes. "I'm not the one who's slowing us down."

Weiss huffed in annoyance, but deep down she knew that Ruby had a point. She was used to working alone, and her pride was getting in the way of their progress. She took a deep breath and tried to calm down, determined to put their differences aside and focus on the task at hand.

As they continued through the forest, they encountered another pair of students: Yang Xiao Long and Blake Belladonna. Yang was a tall, boisterous girl with long, golden hair, while Blake was a slender, serious-looking girl with long, black hair and cat-like ears.

"Hey, it's Weiss and Ruby!" Yang exclaimed, as the four of them came face to face. "What's up, ladies?"

"We're just trying to make it to the ruins," Weiss said tersely, trying to keep her focus. "We don't have time for small talk."

"Oh, sorry to disappoint," Yang said, grinning. "But we're headed the same way, so maybe we can team up and get there faster. What do you say?"

Weiss hesitated, unsure if she was ready to trust these strangers. But she knew they needed all the help they could get if they were going to survive the Grimm-infested forest. Reluctantly, she nodded.

"Fine," she said. "But we stick together, and we listen to each other. No more bickering."

"Deal," Yang said, extending her hand. "We'll watch each other's backs."

Weiss took her hand and shook it firmly, hoping that this was a decision she wouldn't come to regret.

As the four of them made their way through the forest, Yang and Blake couldn't help but notice the wet patches on Ruby and Weiss's pants. They exchanged a knowing look, and Yang couldn't resist poking fun at their new teammates.

"Hey, did you guys have an accident or something?" she teased, winking at Blake. "Looks like you might want to change your pants before we get to the ruins."

"Shut up, Yang," Ruby said, blushing. "It's not funny."

"Oh, come on," Yang said, grinning. "We all get scared sometimes. Don't worry, we won't tell anyone."

"It's not a big deal," Blake said, more sympathetically. "What matters is that we make it to the ruins and complete the initiation."

Despite their teasing, Yang and Blake were skilled and reliable partners, and together the four of them were able to make their way to the ancient ruins that were their goal. As they approached the crumbling stone structures, they heard a loud, ominous cawing sound above them.

Looking up, they saw a giant nevermore swooping down towards them, its sharp beak glinting in the sunlight.

"Oh god, it's a nevermore!" Ruby exclaimed, drawing her scythe. "We have to take it down!"

"Don't worry, we can do this!" Yang said, cracking her knuckles. "We just have to work together and use our strengths."

Weiss nodded, drawing her rapier and readying herself for the fight. She knew that this would be the true test of her skills and her resolve. It was time to prove to herself and her teammates that she was worthy of being a huntsman.

The four of them sprang into action, each one using their unique abilities to take on the nevermore. Ruby was a blur of motion, her scythe slicing through the air as she dodged and weaved around the giant bird's attacks. Yang was a powerhouse, using her gauntlets to deliver powerful punches and blasts of fire. Blake was a master of stealth and speed, using her katana and shadow clones to distract and disorient the nevermore.

But despite their best efforts, the nevermore was a formidable opponent, and it wasn't long before they all began to tire. As they fought, Yang and Blake also had accidents, their fear and adrenaline getting the best of them. Yang was afraid of snakes, and as one slithered out from under a rock, she let out a yelp and fell to the ground, wetting herself in the process. Blake was afraid of heights, and as the nevermore took to the air, she froze in fear, her own accident soon following.

Weiss couldn't help but feel a sense of solidarity with her teammates, even as she tried to hide her own embarrassment. They were all just kids, trying their best to survive in a dangerous world. She redoubled her efforts, determined to prove that she was just as capable as the rest of them.

But as the fight dragged on, Weiss found herself getting more and more tired. She knew she couldn't hold out much longer, and as the nevermore's attacks grew more fierce, she felt another wet warmth spreading down her legs. She gritted her teeth and tried to push through it, determined not to let her fear get the best of her.

But as the nevermore swung its beak at her, she knew she was done for. She closed her eyes, bracing herself for the blow.

Suddenly, there was a loud, ear-splitting screech, and Weiss felt the nevermore's weight lifted off of her. She opened her eyes to see the giant bird plummeting to the ground, a smoking crater in its chest.

She turned to see Ruby, Yang, and Blake standing behind her, their weapons at the ready. They had defeated the nevermore, and they had done it together.

"We did it!" Ruby exclaimed, grinning. "We're one step closer to becoming huntsmen!"

"Yeah, we rock!" Yang said, high-fiving her sister.

"We couldn't have done it without each other," Blake said, a rare smile crossing her face.

Weiss couldn't help but smile too, despite her own embarrassment. They had all faced their fears and come out on top. They were a team, and she was proud to be a part of it.

As the four huntresses made their way back to Beacon Academy, they couldn't help but laugh and joke about their various accidents.

"I can't believe I wet myself twice in one day," Weiss said, shaking her head in disbelief.

"Hey, at least you're not alone," Yang said, grinning. "I think we all earned a round of drinks after this initiation."

"I'm just glad we made it through," Ruby said, sighing with relief. "I can't wait to tell everyone about our adventure."

As they entered the auditorium, they saw that all the first-year huntresses had gathered for an assembly. They took their seats and waited anxiously as Glynda Goodwitch, one of the professors at Beacon, stepped up to the podium.

"Welcome, first-year huntresses," she said, her voice stern but reassuring. "You have all proven yourselves to be capable and brave, and I am confident that you will go on to great things as huntresses. But I must warn you, the path you have chosen will not be easy. The Grimm are a constant threat, and you will face challenges that you can't even imagine.

"And sometimes, when you confront the Grimm, you will have accidents. It is a natural response to fear and stress, and it does not make you any less of a huntress. What matters is how you face those challenges and come out on the other side. You must be strong, not just in body, but in spirit as well.

"So don't be ashamed of your fears or your weaknesses. Embrace them, and use them to make you stronger. That is what being a huntress is all about. Do you understand?"

The first-year huntresses nodded, their faces solemn as they took in Glynda's words. They knew that the road ahead would be difficult, but they were ready to face it together. They were huntresses, and they would stand strong, no matter what challenges came their way.

Glynda's eyes scanned the crowd, her gaze lingering on Ruby, Yang, Blake, and Weiss. "But remember, huntresses, that you must also keep up morale, both for yourselves and for those around you. That means hiding your accidents and pretending that they never happened.

"We all know that the Grimm are a formidable enemy, and if people see that even their heroes can be afraid, it could shatter their confidence and hope. That is why it is important to keep up a strong front, no matter how hard it may be.

"Of course, this does not mean that you should not confront and overcome your fears. On the contrary, it is only through facing and overcoming your fears that you will grow as huntresses. But you must do so quietly, and not let it affect the morale of those around you.

"And remember, huntresses who have too many accidents will be punished. We have a strict policy here at Beacon, and those who cannot control their fear will be spanked, both as a punishment and as a way to help them overcome their weakness."

The first-year huntresses gasped at the mention of spanking, their faces turning pale at the thought. They knew that they would have to be careful, and that they would have to work hard to control their fear and their accidents.

They left the auditorium with renewed determination, ready to face the trials ahead and emerge as true huntresses.

As Team RWBY drifted off to sleep in their shared dorm, Blake found herself plagued by a nightmare. She was back in the forest, fighting the nevermore, but this time she was alone, her teammates nowhere to be found. She froze in fear as the giant bird swooped down at her, its sharp beak glinting in the sunlight.

She woke up with a start, her heart pounding in her chest. She felt a warm, wet sensation beneath her, and she realized with horror that she had wet the bed.

She looked around, hoping that no one had noticed, but she saw that Weiss was awake, staring at her with a mixture of amusement and disgust.

"Oh my god, Blake," Weiss said, shaking her head. "I can't believe you wet the bed. You're such a baby."

Blake's face turned red with embarrassment. "Shut up, Weiss," she muttered, pulling the covers over her head. "It's not my fault. I had a nightmare."

"Well, maybe you should try to control your nightmares better," Weiss said, rolling her eyes. "Or at least wear a diaper to bed if you can’t hold it."

Blake's anger dissipated as she caught a faint, familiar smell emanating from Weiss's bed. She realized that her teammate had had an accident of her own, and that she was trying to deflect attention from it.

"Hey, wait a minute," Blake said, sniffing the air. "I smell something. Did you... did you have an accident too, Weiss?"

Weiss's face paled, and for a moment she looked like she was going to deny it. But then she let out a sigh and hung her head.

"Fine," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I had a nightmare too. And I... I pooped the bed. I couldn't help it, I was so scared."

Blake couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction as Weiss admitted the truth. She knew that it was mean to revel in her teammate's embarrassment, but she couldn't resist the urge to poke fun at her.

"Ha! I knew it," she said, grinning. "Looks like we're both babies after all. Good thing we have each other to keep us company."

Weiss glared at her, but Blake could see the hint of a smile on her face. They may have been mean to each other, but deep down they were still friends, and they knew that they would always have each other's backs, no matter what.

A week after the initiation, Glynda Goodwitch took a group of first-year huntresses, including Ruby, Yang, Blake, and Weiss, on a field trip to Forever Fall. The lush, red-leaved forest was known for its rare and valuable sap, which was often collected by huntsmen and huntresses as a training exercise.

As they made their way through the forest, Glynda explained the finer points of sap collection, including the proper way to tap the trees and the importance of protecting the environment. The first-year huntresses listened attentively, eager to learn and impress their mentor.

But as they went deeper into the forest, they began to sense a strange presence lurking in the shadows. They could hear the rustling of leaves and the snapping of twigs, but no matter how hard they looked, they couldn't see anything.

"I don't like this," Ruby whispered, her scythe at the ready. "I have a bad feeling about this."

"Me too," Yang said, her gauntlets glowing with heat. "We should get out of here."

"We can't leave now," Glynda said, her voice firm. "We have a job to do, and we must see it through to the end. But stay alert, and be ready for anything."

The first-year huntresses nodded, their nerves on edge as they continued their work. They knew that the Grimm were always a threat, and they were determined not to let fear get the best of them.

But as they tapped the trees and collected the sap, they couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. And as the shadows seemed to shift and move around them, they knew that they were in for a fight.

Just as they thought they had the situation under control, Glynda received a call on her scroll, summoning her back to Beacon Academy immediately. She left the first-year huntresses with strict instructions to return to the school as soon as they were finished, but as they gathered their things and prepared to leave, they found themselves separated from the rest of the teams.

"Where did everyone go?" Ruby asked, looking around frantically. "We were all just here a minute ago."

"I don't know," Blake said, her ears twitching as she listened for any sign of the others. "But we have to find them. We can't be alone in Forever Fall."

"Right," Yang said, her fists clenched. "We have to stick together and stay strong. We can do this."

The first-year huntresses set off into the forest, determined to find their teammates and get back to Beacon safely. They knew that they were facing danger on all sides, but they were ready to fight and protect each other. They were Team RWBY, and they were united in their determination to survive.

As they searched for their teammates, Team RWBY suddenly heard the sound of snarling and growling coming from all around them. They turned just in time to see a pack of Grimm emerging from the shadows, their eyes glowing with malice.

"Oh no," Ruby breathed, her scythe at the ready. "We have to fight!"

As Team RWBY faced off against the Grimm, they couldn't help but feel a sense of fear and panic. They had faced Grimm before, but they had never been this outnumbered, and they had never been this far from home.

As the Grimm attacked intensified, the four huntresses fought with all their might, their weapons flashing as they cut down their foes. But despite their best efforts, they were no match for the relentless Grimm, and they found themselves struggling to keep up.

"I can't do this!" Ruby shouted, her voice hoarse as she swung her scythe. "I'm not ready for this!"

"Me neither!" Yang yelled, her gauntlets glowing as she smashed through a horde of Grimm. "I'm so scared!"

"We all are," Blake said, her voice strained as she fought off a group of beowolves. "But we have to keep going. We can't let our fear control us."

"Easy for you to say," Weiss said, panting as she parried a blow from a boarbatusk. "I think I just peed myself."

The other huntresses looked at Weiss in shock as they saw the wet patch on her pants. They couldn't believe that their normally composed teammate had had an accident, and they couldn't help but feel a sense of shame and embarrassment.

"Oh my god, Weiss," Ruby said, shaking her head. "That's so gross."

"It's not gross," Weiss said, her face red with shame. "It's just... it's just a natural response to fear. We all have accidents sometimes."

"Yeah, well, maybe you should have worn a diaper" Yang said, grinning despite the fear and anxiety on her face.

"Shut up, Yang," Blake said, her eyes narrowed. "This is serious. We have to get out of here before something worse happens."

As the fight raged on, the huntresses continued to struggle with their fear and their accidents. They knew that they were outmatched and outgunned, but they refused to give up. They were huntresses, and they would stand strong, no matter what the Grimm threw at them.

As the fight raged on, Team RWBY found themselves struggling more and more with their fear and their accidents. They had all had at least one accident by this point, and they were starting to feel embarrassed and humiliated.

Ruby had pooped herself when a beowolf had snuck up on her from behind, and she had been too scared to do anything about it. Yang had peed herself when a nevermore had swooped down at her from the sky, and she had been too afraid to move. Blake had pooped herself when a boarbatusk had charged at her from the side, taking her by surprise.

And as for Weiss, she had pooped herself twice, once when a death stalker had appeared out of nowhere, and once when a giant ursa had roared in her face. She had been mortified by her accidents, and she had tried to hide them from her teammates, but it had been impossible.

Despite their fear and their accidents, the huntresses refused to give up. They knew that they were outmatched and outgunned, but they refused to let that hold them back. They were huntresses, and they would stand strong, no matter what the Grimm threw at them.

Just when it seemed like all hope was lost, they were rescued by Qrow, drunken huntsman and Yang’s uncle. He appeared out of nowhere, his scythe flashing as he cut down the Grimm with ease.

"Need some help?" he said, grinning as he helped the huntresses to their feet.

"Yes!" Ruby said, tears streaming down her face. "We were so scared!"

"I can see that," Qrow said, his eyes scanning the wet and dirty pants of the huntresses. "Looks like you all had a rough time. But don't worry, I'm here now. I'll get you out of here."

The huntresses nodded, grateful for Qrow's help. They knew that they couldn't have survived without him, and they vowed to work harder and overcome their fear so that they wouldn't have any more accidents. They were huntresses, and they would stand strong, no matter what the Grimm threw at them.

After being rescued by Qrow, Team RWBY, along with Nora Valkyrie and Pyrrha Nikos, returned to Beacon Academy, where they were debriefed by Glynda Goodwitch. The strict but fair headmistress listened as the huntresses told her about their experiences in Forever Fall, including their accidents and their fear.

"I understand that you all faced a difficult and frightening situation," Glynda said, her voice stern but understanding. "But as huntresses, it is our duty to confront our fear and overcome it. We cannot let it control us or hold us back."

The huntresses nodded, shamefaced as they listened to their mentor. They knew that they had let their fear get the best of them, and they vowed to work harder and be stronger in the future.

"We'll do better, Glynda," Ruby said, her voice barely above a whisper. "We promise."

"I know you will, Ruby," Glynda said, her voice softening. "You all have great potential, and I have no doubt that you will become excellent huntresses. But remember, you must always be prepared for the unexpected. The Grimm are unpredictable, and they will always test your limits. Be ready for anything."

The huntresses nodded, their eyes filled with determination. They knew that they had a long road ahead of them, and that they would have to work hard and overcome their fear if they wanted to succeed. But they were ready for the challenge, and they were determined to become the best huntresses they could be.

After debriefing the huntresses on their mission, Glynda Goodwitch reminded them of the consequences for having too many accidents.

"You all should know by now that the punishment for having too many accidents is a spanking," Glynda said, her voice stern. "And while I understand that you were in a difficult and frightening situation, that does not excuse your behavior. You are huntresses, and you are expected to maintain a certain level of discipline and control at all times."

The huntresses nodded, their faces red with shame as they listened to their mentor. They knew that they had let their fear get the best of them, and they knew that they deserved to be punished.

"Now, Nora and Pyrrha, I see that these were your first accidents, so you will not be punished," Glynda said, turning to the pink-haired huntress and the Invincible Girl. "But the rest of you will need to be disciplined. Ruby, Yang, Blake, and Weiss, you will all receive a spanking for your behavior."

The huntresses nodded, their eyes downcast as they accepted their punishment. They knew that they had let themselves and their teammates down, and they were ready to accept their punishment.

"Now, get to your dorm and wait for me," Glynda said, her voice firm. "I will be there shortly to administer your punishment. And remember, this is for your own good. You must learn to control your fear and your accidents if you want to be successful huntresses."

When Glynda Goodwitch arrived at Team RWBY's dorm room, she found the four huntresses waiting for her, their eyes downcast and their faces red with shame. They knew that they had let their fear get the best of them, and they knew that they deserved to be punished.

"Take off your pants," Glynda said, her voice firm as she stood in front of the huntresses. "You will receive your punishment now."

The huntresses nodded, their hands shaking as they obeyed their mentor. They knew that a spanking was not going to be pleasant, but they were determined to take it like the mature and responsible huntresses that they were.

As they removed their pants, Glynda examined their accidents, her eyes narrowing as she saw the wet and dirty patches on their undergarments. She knew that this was not the first time that these huntresses had had accidents, and she was determined to teach them a lesson.

"This is not acceptable behavior," Glynda said, her voice stern. "As huntresses, you must maintain control of your bodily functions at all times. You cannot let fear or stress overcome you."

The huntresses nodded, their faces red with shame as they listened to their mentor. They knew that they had let themselves and their teammates down, and they vowed to do better in the future.

"Bend over and grab your ankles," Glybda said, her voice firm. "You will receive your punishment now."

The huntresses nodded, their eyes closed as they prepared for their punishment. They knew that it was going to be painful, but they were determined to take it like the mature and responsible huntresses that they were.

And with a loud crack, the spanking began, the sound of Glynda's hand smacking against their panty-clad bottoms echoing through the room. The huntresses cried out in pain, their faces red and tears streaming down their cheeks. But they knew that this punishment was for their own good, and they were determined to learn from it.

As Glynda Goodwitch spanked the huntresses one by one, they cried out in pain, their faces red and tears streaming down their cheeks. Yang was spanked first, her loud yelps filling the room as Glynda smacked her bottom with a firm hand. Blake was next, her cries of pain just as loud as Yang's as she received her punishment.

As Blake's spanking came to an end, Weiss watched with a mix of fear and anticipation, knowing that her turn was next. She couldn't help but feel scared and anxious, and as the anticipation built, she felt her bladder start to give way.

"Oh no," she whispered, her face red with shame as she felt a warm wetness spreading between her legs. "I can't believe this is happening."

As Glynda turned to spank Weiss, she noticed the wet patch on her underwear and raised an eyebrow. "Another accident, Weiss?" she said, her voice stern. "This is becoming a pattern, and it's not acceptable behavior for a huntress."

"I'm sorry, Glynda," Weiss said, her voice trembling as she tried to hold back her tears. "I didn't mean to have another accident. I was just so scared and anxious, and I couldn't control it."

"Well, you'll have to learn to control it if you want to be a successful huntress," Glynda said, her voice firm. "Now, bend over and grab your ankles. You'll receive your punishment now."

Weiss nodded, her face red with shame as she obeyed her mentor. She knew that this spanking was going to be especially painful and embarrassing,

As Glynda Goodwitch spanked the huntresses one by one, they cried out in pain, their faces red and tears streaming down their cheeks.

Now it was Ruby's turn, and as she bent over and grabbed her ankles, she couldn't help but feel scared and anxious. She had never been spanked before, and she wasn't sure if she was ready for it.

As Glynda raised her hand, Ruby closed her eyes and braced herself for the pain. But as the first swat landed, she felt something else entirely - a warm wetness spreading between her legs.

"Oh no," she whispered, her face red with shame as she realized what had happened. "I can't believe this is happening."

As Glynda noticed the wet patch on Ruby's underwear, she raised an eyebrow. "Another accident, Ruby?" she said, her voice stern. "This is becoming a pattern, and it's not acceptable behavior for a huntress."

"I'm sorry, Glynda," Ruby said, her voice trembling as she tried to hold back her tears. "I didn't mean to have another accident. I was just so scared and anxious, and I couldn't control it."

"Well, you'll have to learn to control it if you want to be a successful huntress," Glynda said, her voice firm. "Accidents are a natural response to fear and stress, but as huntresses, we must strive to control them. We cannot let our emotions control us, or we will not be able to do our jobs effectively."

Ruby nodded, her face red with shame as she listened to her mentor. She knew that she had let her fear and anxiety get the best of her, and she vowed to do better in the future.

"I'll do better, Glynda," Ruby said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I promise."

"I know you will, Ruby," Glynda said, her voice softening. "You are a talented huntress, and I have no doubt that you will overcome this obstacle. But remember, it takes time and practice to control your emotions. Don't be too hard on yourself."

Ruby nodded, her eyes filled with determination as she listened to her mentor. She knew that she had a lot of work to do, but she was ready for the challenge. She was a huntress, and she would stand strong, no matter what the Grimm threw at her.

Weeks passed, and as Team RWBY continued their training at Beacon Academy, they began to realize that they needed to go shopping for new underwear. They had all had so many accidents during the initiation and their missions that their current underwear was beyond repair, and they needed to restock.

"I can't believe how much underwear we've gone through," Yang said, shaking her head as she looked at the pile of dirty and wet underwear in their dorm room. "We must have gone through at least a dozen pairs each."

"I know, right?" Ruby said, her eyes wide as she looked at the pile. "I've never had to go through this many pairs before. I think we're going to have to go shopping for more."

"I think you're right, Ruby," Weiss said, her nose wrinkled in disgust as she looked at the pile. "This is just gross. We need to get some new underwear as soon as possible."

"Agreed," Blake said, nodding as she looked at the pile. "We can't keep wearing underwear that's been pooped or peed in. It's unsanitary and gross."

The huntresses of Team RWBY went shopping for new underwear, determined to restock and start fresh. As they walked into the lingerie store, they were greeted by a friendly salesperson, who asked if they needed any help finding anything.

"We're just looking for some new underwear," Ruby said, her face red with embarrassment. "We've gone through a lot of pairs lately, and we need to restock."

"No problem," the salesperson said, a friendly smile on her face. "We have a wide selection of underwear in all sizes and styles. What are you looking for today?"

The huntresses looked at each other, unsure of what to say. They had never had to buy so much underwear before, and they weren't sure what they wanted.

"I don't know," Weiss said, her voice uncertain. "Something comfortable, I guess. And maybe something that won't get ruined if we have an accident."

"Ah, I see," the salesperson said, her eyes twinkling with understanding. "Well, we have some moisture-wicking underwear that might be perfect for you. It's designed to keep you dry and comfortable, no matter what. Would you like to try some on?"

The huntresses nodded, their faces red with embarrassment as they followed the salesperson to the fitting rooms.

They tried on the moisture-wicking underwear, determined to find the perfect pair to help them overcome their fear and become successful huntresses. The salesperson had recommended a pale pink pair with a lace trim, made of a soft and stretchy material that promised to keep them dry and comfortable no matter what.

As Weiss tried on her new pair, she couldn't help but feel excited. She had never owned such high-quality underwear before, and she couldn't wait to wear them on her next mission.

But as she was adjusting the waistband, someone knocked over a shelf in the store, causing a loud bang that echoed through the fitting rooms. Weiss jumped, her heart racing as she felt a surge of fear wash over her.

"Oh no," she whispered, her face red with shame as she felt a warm wetness spreading between her legs. "I can't believe this is happening."

The salesperson, who had heard the commotion, came over to see if everything was okay. When she saw Weiss' wet underwear, she raised an eyebrow.

"It looks like you'll have to buy these now, dear," the salesperson said, her voice sympathetic. "Accidents happen, and we can't let them go to waste. These are some of our best-selling underwear, so I'm sure you'll love them."

Weiss nodded, her face red with embarrassment as she paid for her new underwear. She knew that this was going to be an expensive shopping trip, but she was determined to do whatever it took to overcome her fear and become a successful huntress.

As the huntresses of Team RWBY left the lingerie store with their new underwear, they had no idea that their soiled underwear was causing a stir at Beacon Academy. In the laundry room, two men were sorting through the dirty laundry.

"What the hell is this?" the new guy, Tim, said, holding up a pair of underwear with a disgusted look on his face. "Is this poop or something?"

The other guy, Joe, sighed and shook his head. "It's just huntress' underwear, Tim," he said, his voice tired. "They have a lot of accidents, and we have to deal with it."

"Accidents?" Tim said, his eyes wide. "What kind of accidents?"

"You know," Joe said, his voice low. "Accidents. Like when someone gets scared or stressed and they pee or poop themselves. It happens to all the huntresses, and we have to deal with it."

"But that's gross," Tim said, his face turning pale. "I can't believe I have to deal with this."

"Welcome to the job," Joe said, his voice sarcastic. "It's not easy, but it pays the bills. Now come on, we have to get this laundry sorted and into the wash before anyone else sees it. We don't want to give the huntresses any more embarrassment than they already have."

As Tim sorted through the dirty laundry, he couldn't help but feel disgusted by the stains that he saw. There was poop and pee everywhere, and it seemed like every pair of underwear had some kind of stain on it.

"This is gross," he muttered to himself, his face turning red as he held up a pair of pink underwear with a large brown stain on them. "Who does this kind of stuff?"

But as he continued to fold the clean and laundered underwear, he couldn't help but notice that some of the stains were still there. Despite his best efforts, he had been unable to completely remove them, and he knew that the huntresses would be embarrassed when they saw them.

The underwear was a mix of colors and styles, ranging from basic white cotton to lacy and intricate designs. There were thongs, boyshorts, and briefs, all in different sizes and shapes. Some of the underwear was plain and simple, while others were adorned with patterns and prints.

Tim sighed as he folded the underwear, knowing that this was going to be a long and difficult job. He knew that the huntresses of Beacon Academy had a lot of accidents, and he couldn't help but feel sorry for them. He knew that it must be hard to deal with the constant embarrassment, and he vowed to do his best to keep their secrets safe.

As Tim finished folding the clean and laundered underwear, he couldn't help but wonder what the huntresses would think when they saw the stains that were still there. He knew that they would be embarrassed, and he felt sorry for them.

But as he placed the folded underwear back in the hamper, he didn't realize that someone else was about to see it.

Jaune Arc was in Team RWBY's dorm room, studying for a test with Ruby when she accidentally knocked over the laundry hamper. As the clean and laundered underwear tumbled out, Jaune's eyes went wide with shock as he saw the stains that were still there.

"Oh my god," he said, his voice shaking as he looked at the soiled underwear. "What the hell is this?"

Ruby's face turned red with embarrassment as she saw what had happened. "It's just our underwear," she said, her voice low. "We've had a lot of accidents lately, and we're still trying to get used to it."

"Accidents?" Jaune said, his eyes wide with shock. "What kind of accidents?"

"You know," Ruby said, her voice low. "Accidents. Like when you're scared or stressed and you pee or poop yourself. It happens to all the huntresses, and we have to deal with it."

Jaune's face turned pale as he listened to Ruby's explanation. He couldn't believe what he was hearing, and he couldn't help but feel sorry for the huntresses. He knew that it must be hard to deal with the constant embarrassment, and he vowed to keep their secrets safe.

Jaune couldn't believe what he had seen in Team RWBY's dorm room. He had always known that being a huntress was tough, but he had never realized just how difficult it could be. As he walked back to his own dorm room, he couldn't help but think about what Ruby had told him.

When he got back to his room, he found Pyrrha Nikos sitting at her desk, studying for their test. He couldn't help but wonder if she had had any accidents like the ones he had seen in Ruby's room.

"Hey Pyrrha," he said, his voice low. "I have to tell you something."

Pyrrha looked up, her eyes curious. "What is it?" she asked.

"I was in Team RWBY's room studying with Ruby, and she accidentally knocked over their laundry hamper," Jaune said, his voice shaking. "And when I looked inside, I saw all their soiled underwear."

Pyrrha's face turned red with embarrassment as she listened to Jaune's story. "Oh no," she said, her voice low. "That must have been so embarrassing for them."

"I know," Jaune said, his voice soft. "But Ruby told me that it happens to all the huntresses. They have accidents when they're scared or stressed. Do you have accidents too?"

Pyrrha nodded, her face red with shame. "Yes, I do," she said, her voice low. "It's a natural response to fear and stress, and we have to learn to control it. But it's not easy, and sometimes we have accidents despite our best efforts."

Jaune couldn't believe what he was hearing. He had always known that being a huntress was tough, but he had never realized just how difficult it could be. He had always admired Pyrrha's strength and courage, and he couldn't believe that she had accidents too.

"I'm so sorry, Pyrrha," he said, his voice low. "I had no idea that this was something that you had to deal with. I've never noticed any accidents from you."

Pyrrha shrugged, her face red with embarrassment. "That's because we have to hide them," she said, her voice low. "Huntresses are supposed to be strong and brave, and we can't let our accidents show. We have to keep up morale, and we can't let anyone see our weaknesses."

"But that's not fair," Jaune said, his voice angry. "You shouldn't have to hide your accidents. You're still a human being, and you have the right to be vulnerable. You shouldn't have to pretend to be someone you're not."

Pyrrha sighed, her eyes sad. "I know, Jaune," she said, her voice low. "But it's the way things are. We have to follow the rules, and we can't let anyone see our weaknesses. It's just the way things are."

Jaune nodded, his heart heavy as he listened to Pyrrha's explanation. He knew that she was right, and he vowed to do his best to support her and keep her secrets safe. He knew that it wasn't going to be easy, but he was determined to do whatever it took to help his friends.
